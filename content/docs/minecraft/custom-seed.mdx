## Introduction

Sometimes we don't want a random seed, but a custom one. Once we find it, we can use it on a server, this will tell you how.

## How to Set Custom Seed

<Steps>
    <Step>
	**Log in** to our lagless game panel
	</Step>
    <Step>
	Navigate to the **Files** tab and search for the **server.properties** file. 
		<Callout type="warning">
			Your server must be started at least once for this file to be generated.
		</Callout>
	</Step>
    <Step>
	Search for the field 
	`level-seed=`
	</Step>
    <Step>
	Insert a seed string of your choosing after the equals sign. For example:  
	`level-seed=2231252140388046750`
	</Step>
	<Step>
    Click **Save Content** of the file.
	</Step>
	<Step>
    **Stop** the server completely.
	</Step>
	<Step>
    Delete the existing world folder to make space for the new world
		<Callout type="danger">
			This will permanently erase all buildings, items, and player data from the current world. Make sure you have a backup if you wish to keep anything.
        </Callout>

    **Start** the server. Your new world should now be generated with the new seed.
